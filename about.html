        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          We are a small, passionate team dedicated to making meaningful games. Each member brings their own creativity and skills, united by a love for rich storytelling. What began as a few friends sharing ideas has grown into a collaborative studio focused on innovation and authenticity. We value learning, experimentation, and the joy of bringing new worlds to life. Our mission is to make games that leave a lasting impression and build lasting connections with players. At T-Games, every story starts with people who care.

        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          At T-Games, storytelling is at the core of everything we do. We believe games are a unique way to share experiences and emotions that resonate deeply with players. Our goal is to create worlds that feel authentic and choices that truly impact the journey. Every project starts with a spark of imagination and grows through passion and care. We focus on crafting narratives that invite players to explore, reflect, and connect. For us, a great story is the heart of a great game.
