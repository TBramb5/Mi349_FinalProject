        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>
          Weâ€™re a small, dedicated team passionate about creating meaningful games. Each of us brings our own creativity and skills, united by a shared love of storytelling. What began as a few friends exchanging ideas has grown into a collaborative studio focused on authenticity and innovation. We embrace learning, experimentation, and the joy of crafting new worlds. Our mission is to create games that leave a lasting impact and build genuine connections with players.

        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          At T-Games, stories are everything to us. We see games as a special way to share feelings and moments that really stick with players. Our aim is to build worlds that feel real and choices that actually matter. Every game starts with a simple idea and grows with a lot of heart and passion. We want to create stories that invite players to explore, think, and connect. For us, a great game always begins with a great story.
